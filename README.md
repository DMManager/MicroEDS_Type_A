# Product description
Version 1.0 of MicroEDS was mainly designed to detect events in a drinking water distribution system; however, the user can adjust this version to operate in other domains. The manual covers installation, model setup and training, runtime monitoring, communication with other systems, and troubleshooting. The installation kit includes a demo database and instantly puts the system in Run mode. However, it also provides the user with a comprehensive explanation of building a database and linking it to other organisational systems.
